In Fig.~\ref{fig:movie}, we plot the stellar structure vs.~mass coordinate in the simulation which employs the Brown model and has $M = 1.1M_\odot$ and [Fe/H] $= -0.2$.
We limit the x-limits of the plot to the mass coordinate energy generation peak of the hydrogen burning shell on the left $m_{\rm max}$, and to $1.1 m_{\rm max}$ on the right.
An animated version of this figure is available online in the HTML version of the draft.
