The following section presents a derivation of the fluid parameter known as the ``reduced density ratio,'' which \textbf{is a fundamental parameter in fluid models of thermohaline mixing, and measures the stability of a given fluid configuration to the instability that drives thermohaline mixing}. 
Section \ref{sec:parameterizations} goes into a similar level of detail regarding different prescriptions for thermohaline mixing in 1D stellar models 
to the end of summarizing the prescriptions currently implemented in MESA, and demonstrating key differences between these prescriptions. \textbf{As was noted in Sec.~\ref{intro:subsec:fluids}, while the amount of chemical mixing predicted by these prescriptions does depend on the density ratio (or, equivalently, the reduced density ratio), we stress that the density ratio characterizes stability and thus the tendency to mix, not the actual amount of mixing or mixing efficiency (which is characterized by $\Dth$, introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:parameterizations}).}

The instability driving thermohaline mixing requires a Ledoux-stable inversion of the mean molecular weight $\mu$ stratification in the presence of a stable temperature gradient. 
The stability of the temperature gradient is given by the Schwarzschild criterion:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Schwarzschild}
    \gradrad - \gradad < 0,
\end{equation}
where the temperature gradient $\grad \equiv d \ln P / d \ln T$ (pressure $P$ and temperature $T$) has an adiabatic value $\grad = \gradad$ and saturates to $\grad = \gradrad$ in hydrostatically stable regions where the flux is carried radiatively. 
The Ledoux criterion for convective stability is \citep{Ledoux1947}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Ledoux}
    \gradrad - \gradad - \frac{\phi}{\delta}\gradmu < 0,
\end{equation}
which must be satisfied despite the inversion of the mean molecular weight.
The Ledoux criterion accounts for the composition gradient $\gradmu = d\ln\mu/d\ln P$, where $\delta = -(\partial \ln \rho / \partial \ln T)_{P,\mu}$ and $\phi = (\partial \ln \rho / \partial \ln\mu)_{P,T}$ (where $\rho$ is density).

\textbf{To be unstable, the destabilizing $\mu$ gradient (the free energy source that drives thermohaline mixing) must be sufficiently strong relative to the stabilizing influence of the temperature gradient. This is quantified by the density ratio,}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:R0}
    R_0 \equiv \frac{\grad - \gradad}{\frac{\phi}{\delta} \gradmu},
\end{equation}
where $R_0 < 1$ implies the $\mu$ gradient is sufficiently unstable to drive convection, and $R_0 > 1$ implies the fluid is stably-stratified (i.e.~no convection)\footnote{Note that $R_0>1$ is equivalent to the Ledoux criterion Eq.~\eqref{eq:Ledoux} only if $\grad = \gradrad$. Thermohaline mixing primarily mixes chemicals, but does produce some minimal thermal mixing \citep[see, e.g., Fig.~4 of][]{brown_etal_2013}; thus, $\grad \neq \gradrad$. This thermal mixing is often ignored in mixing prescriptions in 1D stellar evolution programs, however.}. 
As reviewed by \citet{garaud_DDC_review_2018}, fluids with $R_0 > 1$ can be prone to double-diffusive instabilities whenever the thermal diffusivity, $\kappa_T$, is greater than the compositional diffusivity, $\kappa_\mu$. Specifically, the instability driving thermohaline mixing acts whenever

\begin{equation} \label{eq:R0_condition}
1 < R_0 < 1/\tau,
\end{equation}
\citep{baines_gill_1969} where
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tau}
    \tau \equiv \kappa_\mu/\kappa_T.
\end{equation}
Note that in stellar radiation zones, typically $\tau \lesssim 10^{-6}$. This means that very slight inversions of $\mu$ (large $R_0$) can drive thermohaline mixing, even when the temperature gradient is strongly stable according to the Schwarzschild criterion. 

Throughout this paper, we express the density ratio $R_0$ in terms of the \textit{reduced density ratio}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:r}
    r \equiv \frac{R_0 - 1}{\tau^{-1} - 1}
\end{equation}
per, e.g., \citet{traxler_etal_2011,brown_etal_2013}.
In terms of $r$, the condition for thermohaline instability, Eq.~\eqref{eq:R0_condition}, is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:r_condition}
    0 < r < 1,
\end{equation}
where $r \leq 0$ is the threshold for convection and $r \geq 1$ corresponds to scenarios where the $\mu$ inversion is too weak to drive the thermohaline instability.
