\begin{abstract}
\textbf{[NOT DONE]}
The existence of enhanced extra mixing in low-mass upper giant branch stars has been well documented for decades. It has been widely assumed that this extra mixing is related to the thermohaline instability present in fluid simulations with mean molecular weight inversions in otherwise stably stratified zones, but direct comparison to these numerical simulations has been challenging. %It was suggested that their extra mixing might be due to thermohaline convection, which relies on ( mean molecular weight inversions in otherwise stably stratified zones). However, previous attempts to match the observed pattern quantitatively using one dimensional stellar evolution models have usually required some sort of ad hoc increase in the efficacy of the thermohaline mixing, and recent three dimensional simulations  have suggested contradictory results on how the amount of mixing should depend on the fluid parameters of the star in question. 
With MESA, we show here that we are able to compute the necessary fluid parameters, including the reduced density ratios, for stars at a range of masses and metallicities. Combining these modeling results with carbon to nitrogen measurements from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey, \textbf{we provide a framework to qualitatively compare these three dimensional fluid simulations to the amount of extra mixing on the upper giant branch.} We show that the amount of extra mixing is indeed strongly correlated with the reduced density ratio, which suggests that this is a valid framework for exploring the physics of this mixing. We also show that there is increased mixing at low reduced density values, which is inconsistent with current strongly magnetic three dimensional implementations of the thermohaline instability. Finally, we show that stars with available mixing data tend on average to be at relatively low inverse density ratios, which informs the regime which might be interesting to probe with future simulations. %have suggested that even moderate magnetic fields could greatly enhance the efficiency of thermhaline mixing, but questions have arisen about the reliability of those predictions given (some simulation limitations). We therefore use the data from the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey of stars covering a range of masses and metallicities to put empirical constraints on the efficiency of mixing as a function of (R0- define) in order to constrain future theoretical investigations. We find that (stuff) and show that this would suggest (cool things).
