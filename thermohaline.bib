	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Numerous spectroscopic observations provide compelling evidence for a non-canonical mixing process that modifies the surface abundances of Li, C and N of low-mass red giants when they reach the bump in the luminosity function. Eggleton and collaborators have proposed that a molecular weight inversion created by the {\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}He({\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}He, 2p){\textless}sup{\textgreater}4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}He reaction may be at the origin of this mixing, and relate it to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. We argue that one is actually dealing with a double diffusive instability referred to as thermohaline convection and we discuss its influence on the red giant branch.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}We compute stellar models of various initial metallicities that include thermohaline mixing, which is treated as a diffusive process based on the prescription given originally by Ulrich for the turbulent diffusivity produced by the thermohaline instability in stellar radiation zones.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Thermohaline mixing simultaneously accounts for the observed behaviour of the carbon isotopic ratio and of the abundances of Li, C and N in the upper part of the red giant branch. It significantly reduces the {\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}He production with respect to canonical evolution models as required by measurements of {\textless}sup{\textgreater}3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}He/H in galactic HII regions.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater}Thermohaline mixing is a fundamental physical process that must be included in stellar evolution modeling.},

	abstract = {Double-diffusive convection has been well studied in geophysical contexts, but detailed investigations of the regimes characteristic of stellar or planetary interiors have only recently become feasible. As most astrophysical fluids are electrically conducting, it is possible that magnetic fields play a role in either enhancing or suppressing double-diffusive convection, but to date there have been no numerical investigations of such possibilities. Here we study the effects of a vertical background magnetic field (aligned with the gravitational axis) on the linear stability and nonlinear saturation of fingering (thermohaline) convection, through a combination of theoretical work and direct numerical simulations. We find that a vertical magnetic field rigidifies the fingers along the vertical direction, which has the remarkable effect of enhancing vertical mixing. We propose a simple analytical model for mixing by magnetized fingering convection, and argue that magnetic effects may help explain discrepancies between theoretical and observed mixing rates in low-mass red giant branch stars. Other implications of our findings are also discussed.},
