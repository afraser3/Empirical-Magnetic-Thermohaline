\textbf{Evan}: Fill this in better.

The model in mesa \citep{mesa2} is \citet{ulrich_1972, kippenhahn_etal_1980}.

An empirical fit to simulations comes from \citet{traxler_etal_2011}.

A semi-analytical model that can be derived from first principles with free parameters that are fit to data from simulations \citet{brown_etal_2013}.

These new implementations are used in \citep{bauer_bildsten_2019} and other works.

(cite) paper is the paper that implements these new models in MESA and it's been there since r(put revision here)

\citet{lattanzio_etal_2015} tested one or multiple of these models in a bunch of different codes on the RGB and found X.

There has been other work to do multi-D models of thermohaline mixing \citep{denissenkov_2010, denissenkov_merryfield_2011}, but 2D thermohaline behaves very differently from 3D thermohaline \citep{garaud_brummell_2015}, and so we do not consider that set of data in this work.

\textbf{Adrian}: Start making this plot
Do you need to discuss here? or cite previous work? include plot of Nu vs R0 with the different model/theory predictions, mark simulations, like you did for bring a plot [AF: assuming I finally wrap up my in-prep paper with Pascale, we can just cite that paper and throw in those Nu vs R0 plots]
